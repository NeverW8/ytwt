# YouTube WatchTime
A bash script that allows you to farm watchtime easily

# Install/Setup

* Clone the repo "git clone https://github.com/NeverW8/ytwt.git"
* Add your url's to the url.txt file
* Go into your firefox browser and enter your config "about:config", then search for the following "browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash" and set it to true.
* Search for "media.block-autoplay-until-in-foreground" in the firefox config and set it to false. This enables videos to autoplay in a tab out of focus.
* Use a vpn/proxy switcher so your ip don't get flagged or whatnot
* Use an agentswitcher ( i.e https://addons.mozilla.org/sv-SE/firefox/addon/uaswitcher/) with the "random on startup" option enabled.

# Troubleshooting
* Q: My video doesn't autoplay, how can I fix it?
A: Either add "?autoplay=1" at the end of your url's or change ip/proxy/vpn
